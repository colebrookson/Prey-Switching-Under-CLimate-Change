Part 1 - Description of prey populations (done for one 'species')
  1. initialize individuals in an array
  2. assign characteristics (i.e. column names)
    a) this is often positionality, but for now leave that out - availability
    might be important here though
    b) the characteristics will have to be assigned as (ideally, variable)
    values (i.e. coming from a distribution)
    c) also need a space for reproduction
  3. describe reproduction via some function
    a) the function fills a 'characteristics' column
  4. describe death via some function
    a) do it via checking abundnace, assigns probability of indidivual death
      based on some carrying capacity, then realizes death by a Bernoulli trial
      using that assined probability
Part 2 - Description of predator populations
  1. initialize individuals in an array
  2. assign predatory characteristics
  3. describe reproduction
    a) start this with predation -- do this by a sub-function that looks at
      prey overlap with the predator and executes a probobalistic predation
      based on pair-wise traits
    b) use the scaling parameter to calculate the conversion from prey to pred
  4. describe death
    a) can do this through some function of having not eaten for a given amount
      of time.
NOTES:
1. give every process in the IBM it's own function
2. keep a loop (while loop) to move through all the different processes in time
3. don't forget a scaling term to make sure the predator
4. make sure the predation happens before birth/death of the prey

Possible title: 'Species traits and environmental factors interact to structure
predator-prey interactions'
