# Broad Idea
Prey-switching in a spatial context has been posited as a possible mechanism for
predator persistence under global change. But can we actually identify
trait-based switching? And can we figure out when persistence might actually
happen. NOTE: it’s not about actual ABUNDANCE, it’s about AVAILABILITY
– it doesn’t matter how many of the organisms are in the environment, it matters
how accessible they are to the predator. Use an IBM to see if I can detect a
prey-switching event based on the change in the availability of a preferred prey
due to climate. Then, fit real data from the lake system and try to understand
how a warming climate and/or different types of switching may affect predator
persistence.


The ‘switching’ or the shape of the curve can be looked at by the amount they
feed on the littoral organisms versus the deep water organisms when they have
access to both. That confers some selection, which you could think of as being
based on prey size & shape, where in the litoral zone you have a bunch of
larger, fusiform fish and benthic invertebrates, and in the deeper water, you
have smaller, more compact zooplankton and freshwater shrimp. With size being a
major driving component, I’m going to lump this into a size-based ‘large,
nearshore, fish’ prey and ‘small, offshore, shrimp-like’ prey. These traits
can be amalgamated into a ‘multi-trait similarity’.

# Analysis Plan
1. Build spatially-implicit IBM to simulate the prey-switching
2. Try fitting model (see ppt for equations until I get initial doc done)
3. Do a power analysis
4. Try fitting model with more complex IBM (spatially-explicit)
5. Fit model to real data from the lake trout example

# Plan for spatially-implicit IBM:
Should be roughly three components:
1. Description of the prey populations growing
  a) birth
  b) natural death (?)
2. Description of the predator population
  a) birth
3. Description of the prey availability to the predator, and the subsequent
predation on the two prey sources

Part 1 - Description of prey populations (done for one 'species')
  1. initialize individuals in an array
  2. assign characteristics (i.e. column names)
    a) this is often positionality, but for now leave that out - availability
    might be important here though
    b) the characteristics will have to be assigned as (ideally, variable)
    values (i.e. coming from a distribution)
  3.

NOTES:
1. give every process in the IBM it's own function
